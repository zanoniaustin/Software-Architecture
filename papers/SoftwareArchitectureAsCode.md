## Software Architectue as Code

Yes I believe the C4 model abstractions are a great waya to communicate architecture to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The thing I liked the most was the different level diagrams. Being able to start at a high level with one diagram and being able to go deeper into each component helps to keep the diagrams alot more simple and easy to read because you are only looking at specific chunks of the whole at a time. One principle I have always tried to follow myself when trying to even design something out like a feature or story is that anyone should be able to pick this up and understand it. The C4 model tries to follow this by utilizing clear, simple notes and even arrows that have a undestandable description explaing the connection it is making. One problem that the C4 model does have and Simon kinda talked about it a bit is having large systems you are trying to architect. Even in the Level 1 diagram he showed if your high level is a very large system that is utilizing multiple different outside or internal systems that are all connected it could begin to take away that simple clean look, and look like a complicated and complex system that could be hard to understand how everything is connected.
