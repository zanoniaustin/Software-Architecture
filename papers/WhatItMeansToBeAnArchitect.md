## What it Means to be an Architect

One thing that really struck home with me about an important skillset for a architect to have is the ability to make decisions during uncertainty. When he was talking about how how people have viewed architecture vs agile, using agile as an excuse for not making decisions so you can remain "agile" in you development process. In my team I think we have this mindset, I have often begun working on a new feature for our product and been given just a rough description of what it is supposed to do, and then left to my our decisions on how to integrate this into our already existing functionality. Not having an arcitect who is able to see our product as a whole helping to guide me through complex decisions on the development of these features has resulted in me having to constantly rewrite code multiple times until I fully understood how the architecture of our product worked together. Now selfishly this has actually helped me become better at seeing these architectural designs within our product, but it was very inefficient and time consuming compared to having an architect who is able to see the product as a whole and making those difficult decisions that will benefit the team and the product the most.
