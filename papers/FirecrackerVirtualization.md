## Firecracker Virtualization

This paper describes a type of virtual machine that Amazon created for AWS to support the needs of serverless functions.
This paper is not an architecture paper, however, by this point in the course you should be familiar with making architecture decisions based on tradeoffs. 
STEP 1:  When reading the paper, pretend its not a paper describing what AWS built, but instead a proposal to build the firecracker system.  AKA, pretend the paper was written in advance of AWS building firecraker and submitted to AWS CTO - Werner Vogels - as a proposal to fund and support the work to construct it. 
STEP 2:  HIghlight ONE primary architecture decision that you would need to make arguing for the need to create something brand new to support AWS Serverless needs, vs reusing, extending, or enhancing one of the many open source solutions that already existed. 
What to hand in:  A brief writeup on STEP 2 from above.  Motivate why creating a brand new product would be differentiating to AWS, and write it from the perspective that you are trying to convince AWS leadership on undertaking the project.
