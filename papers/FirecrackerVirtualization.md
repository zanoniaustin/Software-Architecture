## Firecracker Virtualization

I would argue that creating a new Placement service for handling Workers. Two of the primary objectives that the Firecracker system is trying to accomplish is Overhead and Density, and Fast Switching. The Placement service is responsible for optimizing the placement of a worker(function) within a large amount of workers while taking into account CPU, memory, and storage; this ability demonstrates it is able to handle a large amount of functions on a single machine with minimal waste. The Placement services is also responsilbe for the lifetime of workers and terminating them when they become idle or redundant. This service should be created from scratch because of how much this management of storage matters to us, as well as how much smaller our containers are compared to competitors. This storage difference should be truly optimized because of the large size difference between ours around 3MB, Hypervisors 13MB, and QEMU 128MB.
