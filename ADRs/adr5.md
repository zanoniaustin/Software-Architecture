# ADR 5: Single Player Game
## Status
Accepted

## Background
In our open world game players solve puzzles, defeat monsters, and progress their character. Do we want this experience to be single-player or allow for multi-player functionality? We are a new company so we do want to make an amazing game focusing on the story telling aspect.

## Rationale 
Allowing for single or multi-player functionality will increase our player base because it will be more appealing to people who only wish to play with others, but requires an internet connection and a more complex setup for communicating between the players and the server. Single-player will allow for offline play and a simpler lightweight database will be able to be used. With a multi-player game we could make more complex challenges and they would be able to experience the story together. With a single-player game we will ahve total control of the story telling as we won't have to worry about players not traveling together.

## Decision 
We have decided to go forward with this just being a single-player game. This decision will allow use to really focus on creating a story that each individual player can experience to the fullest.

## Consequences
Adding multiple player functionality would require a major overhaul of many different aspects of this project. Have each instance of a game not need to communicate with other instances. 


** Tried to do one that wasn't about selecting a technology that is being used, this was definetly more difficult trying to actually put down my thoughts about this decision.
