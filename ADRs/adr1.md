# ADR 1: Unity Game Engine

## Decision 
After investigating multiple gaming engines and all they provide we have decided to move forward using Unity as our Gaming Engine.

## Background
Being a small indie game developer we are needing a Game Engine that has low startup costs, is easy to learn, and has multi platform capability.

## Rationale 
There were many Gaming Engines that were in contention. The two most known engines, and the ones that were the most looked into were Unity and Unreal. These are two of the most used gaming engines for 3D games. Both are well supported with documentation and a community for learning. Unity is known for being easier to learn and has not inital payment required for small games. Unreal requires a flat percent for all profits made from the game.

## Status
Based on our evaluations into different Gaming Engines, it is decided that we will be using the Unity Gaming Engine.

## Consequences
If the game were to get popular there will be an increasing cost to using this gaming engine depending on the yearly income of the game. There are only two langueages supported with the Unity Gaming Engine, C++ and C#
