# ADR 1: Unity Game Engine
## Status
Accepted

## Background
Being a small indie game developer we are needing a Game Engine that has low startup costs, is easy to learn, and has multi platform capability.

## Rationale 
The two 3D gaming engines considered are the most well know engines, Unity and Unreal. For cost being a small company our predicted sales should remain in the free or minimal payment category for Unity, while Unreal requires 5% of every sale made. Unity is commonly known for being very easy to learn and has a large community with alot of documentation, Unreal also has a large community, but would require alot more up front training. Both engines support multi platform functionality.

## Decision 
After investigating multiple gaming engines and all they provide we have decided to move forward using Unity as our Gaming Engine.

## Consequences
If the game were to get popular there will be an increasing cost to using this gaming engine depending on the yearly income of the game. There are only two langueages supported with the Unity Gaming Engine, C++ and C#
